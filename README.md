I took a dataset of a mall's customer from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/mall-customers-segmentation?resource=download
First I had to do data cleaning 
I applied basic funtions for data preparation
I checked for null values and duplicates but there are none
Created a relational graph using a docstring funtions
Created a categorical graph using a docstring funtions
Created a statistical graph using a docstring funtions
Applied kmeans clustering on it
Run test to find the suitable number of clusters required
PLot an elbow plot to find out
Then applied clustering
Also applied fitting
Used Linear regression to make make predictions on clusters and fitting for future data
